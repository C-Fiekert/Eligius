Mobile App Development 2 Assignment 1

For my first assignment in Mobile App Development 2, I chose to create a Cryptocurrency Manager App.
The app has several differnt types of functionality including:

* Listing Portfolios and Coins within them
* Adding Portfolios and Coins
* Updating Coins inside a Portfolio
* Deleting coins from portfolios
* Searching for Portfolios and Coins
* Firebase persistent storage
* Fragment management in a Navigation component
* Transitions between each page
