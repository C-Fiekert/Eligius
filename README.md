Mobile App Development 2 Assignment 2

I chose to create a cryptocurrency management app for this module where users can create portfolios and add coins to track their crypto investments.
The app has several differnt types of functionality including:

* Creating Portfolios
* Creating Coins inside Portfolios
* Can edit coin investments and delete them via swipe functionality
* Search through coins using a search bar
* Filter coins by favourites
* Basic authentication and Google authentication available courtesy of Firebase
* User accounts, portfolios, and coins are stored within a Firebase Realtime Database
* User profile pictures are stored using Firebase Storage
* A simulated Google Pay donation option available (Simulated as app is not in production)
* Convenient bottom navigation available to route to the main pages. Powered by the navigation component
* Text inputs use a fluid and aesthetic TextInputLayout element
* Each page has built in transitions between pages to add a sense of depth
* Dark mode available across the whole app and is user specific
